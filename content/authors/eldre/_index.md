I am a junior researcher in Oceanography. My main scientific activities consist on studing marine ecosystems, particularly how benthic ecosystems (coastal and deep seafloor) and mankind activities interact.

I am interested in marine infauna, but also micro- and macroalgae. Currently, I am working in the Benthic Ecology Laboratory, lead by Philippe Archambault, at Université Laval in Québec (Canada).
