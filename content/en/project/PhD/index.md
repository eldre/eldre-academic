This PhD project is centered on three chapters:

1. characterize infaunal communities and sediment parameters in benthic ecosystems around Sept-Îles (Canada)
2. evaluate which are the individual and cumulative impacts of human activities on this ecosystems
3. develop ecological indicators to assess the Environmental Status in regard to cumulative impacts

We selected the region of Sept-Îles in Québec, where numerous human activities vary in local intensity (*e.g.* international shipping, fisheries, city and industrial waste waters).

Data gathered during this project include benthic infaunal communities composition, sediment abiotic parameters (*e.g.* organic matter, grain-size, heavy-metals), and spatial distribution of selected human activities.
