title: "Cost-benefit analysis of two sampling methods for the study of arctic marine macrobenthos"
event: "Québec-Océan Scientific Meeting"
event_url: https://www.quebec-ocean.ulaval.ca/en
location: "Québec, Canada"
summary: "We present here results from a comparative study of the different sampling techniques used to study macrobenthos: in-situ sampling and photographic identification. A cost-benefit analysis has been done to quantitatively evaluate efficiency of both methods to analyse remote-arctic ecosystems. [poster in French]"
