This project is buidling on the results of the Baie des Sept ÃŽles Environmental Observatory, to create integrative monitoring methods for coastal ecosystems in industrial harbour areas.

Five steps have been established:
1. Identify stress factors in the area through literature review and consultations
2. Create a plan of action relating to user priorities in the area
3. Produce the ecological portrait of communities and habitats with dedicated field studies, leading to recommendations for partners
4. Deploy near-real time tools to monitor key variables in the ecosystems
5. Support actions to prevent anthropogenic perturbation with the Enviro-Alert system
